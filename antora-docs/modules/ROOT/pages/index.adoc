== About

The HACBS Enterprise Contract is a Tekton task that can be used to verify the
provenence of container images built in HACBS and validate them against a set of
policies.

Those policies are defined using the
https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/[rego policy language]
and are described here.

== Release Policy

These rules are applied to pipeline run attestations associated with
container images built by HACBS.

=== Commit Signature Rules

[#disallowed_commit_signature_email]
==== link:#disallowed_commit_signature_email[`disallowed_commit_signature_email`] Signatures is a valid email address

Enterprise Contract verifies if a valid email address was used to sign a commit 

* Path: `data.policy.release.commit_signature.warn`
* Failure message: `Signature %s in commit %s is not a valid email address`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/commit/commit_signature.rego#L12[Source]

[#disallowed_commit_signature_domain]
==== link:#disallowed_commit_signature_domain[`disallowed_commit_signature_domain`] Signatures in a commit that are disallowed

Enterprise Contract has a list of allowed domains that a commit can be signed
off with.

The allowed email domains are:

----
redhat.com
----

* Path: `data.policy.release.commit_signature.warn`
* Failure message: `Signature %s in commit %s has disallowed domain`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/commit/commit_signature.rego#L30[Source]

== Pipeline Policy

These rules are applied to Tekton pipeline definitions.

=== Basic Rules

[#unexpected_kind]
==== link:#unexpected_kind[`unexpected_kind`] Input data has unexpected kind

A sanity check to confirm the input data has the kind "Pipeline"

* Path: `data.policy.pipeline.basic.deny`
* Failure message: `Unexpected kind '%s'`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/pipeline/basic.rego#L19[Source]

=== Required Tasks Rules

[#required_tasks]
==== link:#required_tasks[`required_tasks`] Pipeline does not include all required check tasks

Every build pipeline is expected to contain a set of checks and tests that
are required by the Enterprise Contract. This rule confirms that the pipeline
definition includes all the expected tasks.

The matching is done using the taskRef name rather than the pipeline task name.

The required task refs are:

----
clamav-scan
conftest-clair
get-clair-scan
sanity-inspect-image
sanity-label-check
sast-go
sast-java-sec-check
----

* Path: `data.policy.pipeline.required_tasks.deny`
* Failure message: `Required tasks %s were not found in the pipeline's task list`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/pipeline/required_tasks.rego#L32[Source]

== Release Policy

These rules are applied to pipeline run attestations associated with
container images built by HACBS.

=== Attestation Task Bundle Rules

[#disallowed_task_reference]
==== link:#disallowed_task_reference[`disallowed_task_reference`] Task bundle was not used or is not defined

Check for existence of a task bundle. Enforcing this rule will
fail the contract if the task is not called from a bundle.

* Path: `data.policy.release.attestation_task_bundle.deny`
* Failure message: `Task '%s' does not contain a bundle reference`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/attestation_task_bundle.rego#L16[Source]

[#empty_task_bundle_reference]
==== link:#empty_task_bundle_reference[`empty_task_bundle_reference`] Task bundle reference is empty

Check for a valid task bundle reference being used.

* Path: `data.policy.release.attestation_task_bundle.deny`
* Failure message: `Task '%s' uses an empty bundle image reference`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/attestation_task_bundle.rego#L31[Source]

[#out_of_date_task_bundle]
==== link:#out_of_date_task_bundle[`out_of_date_task_bundle`] Task bundle is out of date

Check if the Tekton Bundle used for the Tasks in the attestation
is the most recent acceptable one. See the list of acceptable
task bundles at xref:acceptable_bundles.adoc#_task_bundles[Acceptable Bundles] or look at
link:https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/data/acceptable_tekton_bundles.yml[data/acceptable_tekton_bundles.yml]
in this git repository.

* Path: `data.policy.release.attestation_task_bundle.warn`
* Failure message: `Task '%s' uses an out of date task bundle '%s'`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/attestation_task_bundle.rego#L50[Source]

[#unacceptable_task_bundle]
==== link:#unacceptable_task_bundle[`unacceptable_task_bundle`] Task bundle is not acceptable

Check if the Tekton Bundle used for the Tasks in the attestation
are acceptable given the tracked effective_on date. See the list of acceptable
task bundles at xref:acceptable_bundles.adoc#_task_bundles[Acceptable Bundles] or look at
link:https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/data/acceptable_tekton_bundles.yml[data/acceptable_tekton_bundles.yml]
in this git repository.

* Path: `data.policy.release.attestation_task_bundle.deny`
* Failure message: `Task '%s' uses an unacceptable task bundle '%s'`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/attestation_task_bundle.rego#L75[Source]

=== Attestation Type Rules

[#unknown_att_type]
==== link:#unknown_att_type[`unknown_att_type`] Unknown attestation type found

A sanity check that the attestation found for the image has the expected
attestation type. Currently there is only one attestation type supported,
`https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1`.

* Path: `data.policy.release.attestation_type.deny`
* Failure message: `Unknown attestation type '%s'`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/attestation_type.rego#L18[Source]

=== Not Useful Rules

[#bad_day]
==== link:#bad_day[`bad_day`] A dummy rule that always fails

It's expected this rule will be skipped by policy configuration.
This rule is for demonstration and test purposes and should be deleted soon.

* Path: `data.policy.release.not_useful.deny`
* Failure message: `It just feels like a bad day to do a release`
* Effective from: `Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000`

=== Step Image Registries Rules

[#disallowed_task_step_image]
==== link:#disallowed_task_step_image[`disallowed_task_step_image`] Task steps ran on container images that are disallowed

Enterprise Contract has a list of allowed registry prefixes. Each step in each
each TaskRun must run on a container image with a url that matches one of the
prefixes in the list.

The allowed registry prefixes are:

----
quay.io/redhat-appstudio/
registry.access.redhat.com/
registry.redhat.io/
----

* Path: `data.policy.release.step_image_registries.deny`
* Failure message: `Step %d in task '%s' has disallowed image ref '%s'`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/step_image_registries.rego#L20[Source]

=== Tasks Rules

[#tasks_missing]
==== link:#tasks_missing[`tasks_missing`] No tasks run

This policy enforces that at least one Task is present in the PipelineRun
attestation.

* Path: `data.policy.release.tasks.deny`
* Failure message: `No tasks found in PipelineRun attestation`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/tasks.rego#L34[Source]

[#tasks_required]

----
add-sbom-and-push
clamav-scan
deprecated-image-check
get-clair-scan
sanity-inspect-image
sanity-label-check
sanity-optional-label-check
sast-go

* Failure message: `Required task(s) '%s' not found in the PipelineRun attestation`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/tasks.rego#L50[Source]

=== Test Rules

[#test_result_skipped]
==== link:#test_result_skipped[`test_result_skipped`] Some tests were skipped

Collects all tests that have their result set to "SKIPPED".

* Failure message: `The following tests were skipped: %s`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/test.rego#L103[Source]

[#test_data_missing]
==== link:#test_data_missing[`test_data_missing`] No test data found

None of the tasks in the pipeline included a HACBS_TEST_OUTPUT
task result, which is where Enterprise Contract expects to find
test result data.

* Path: `data.policy.release.test.deny`
* Failure message: `No test data found`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/test.rego#L16[Source]

[#test_results_missing]
==== link:#test_results_missing[`test_results_missing`] Test data is missing the results key

Each test result is expected to have a 'results' key. In at least
one of the HACBS_TEST_OUTPUT task results this key was not present.

* Path: `data.policy.release.test.deny`
* Failure message: `Found tests without results`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/test.rego#L30[Source]

[#test_result_unsupported]
==== link:#test_result_unsupported[`test_result_unsupported`] Unsupported result in test data

This policy expects a set of known/supported results in the test data
It is a failure if we encounter a result that is not supported.

The supported results are:

----
SUCCESS
FAILURE
ERROR
SKIPPED
----

* Path: `data.policy.release.test.deny`
* Failure message: `Test '%s' has unsupported result '%s'`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/test.rego#L51[Source]

[#test_result_failures]
==== link:#test_result_failures[`test_result_failures`] Test result is FAILURE or ERROR

Enterprise Contract requires that all the tests in the test results
have a successful result. A successful result is one that isn't a
"FAILURE" or "ERROR". This will fail if any of the tests failed and
the failure message will list the names of the failing tests.

* Path: `data.policy.release.test.deny`
* Failure message: `The following tests did not complete successfully: %s`
* https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-policies/blob/main/policy/release/test.rego#L74[Source]
