= Quay expiration

Policies to prevent releasing an image to quay that has a quay expiration date. In Konflux images with an expiration date are produced by "on-pr" build pipelines, i.e. pre-merge CI builds, so this is intended to prevent accidentally releasing a CI build.

== Package name

* `quay_expiration`

== Rules included:

:numbered:

[#quay_expiration__expires_label]
=== link:#quay_expiration__expires_label[Expires label]

Check the image metadata for the presence of a "quay.expires-after" label. If it's present then produce a violation. This check is enforced only for a "release", "production", or "staging" pipeline, as determined by the value of the `pipeline_intention` rule data.

*Solution*: Make sure the image is built without setting the "quay.expires-after" label. This label is usually set if the container image was built by an "on-pr" pipeline during pre-merge CI.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The image has a 'quay.expires-after' label set to '%s'`
* Code: `quay_expiration.expires_label`
