= SBOM CycloneDX Package

Checks different properties of the CycloneDX SBOMs associated with the image being validated.

== Package Name

* `sbom_cyclonedx`

== Rules Included

[#sbom_cyclonedx__allowed]
=== link:#sbom_cyclonedx__allowed[Allowed]

Confirm the CycloneDX SBOM contains only allowed packages. By default all packages are allowed. Use the "disallowed_packages" rule data key to provide a list of disallowed packages.

*Solution*: Update the image to not use any disallowed package.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package is not allowed: %s`
* Code: `sbom_cyclonedx.allowed`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_cyclonedx/sbom_cyclonedx.rego#L35[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_cyclonedx__allowed_package_external_references]
=== link:#sbom_cyclonedx__allowed_package_external_references[Allowed package external references]

Confirm the CycloneDX SBOM contains only packages with explicitly allowed external references. By default all external references are allowed unless the "allowed_external_references" rule data key provides a list of type-pattern pairs that forbid the use of any other external reference of the given type where the reference url matches the given pattern.

*Solution*: Update the image to use only packages with explicitly allowed external references.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package %s has reference %q of type %q which is not explicitly allowed%s`
* Code: `sbom_cyclonedx.allowed_package_external_references`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/sbom_cyclonedx/sbom_cyclonedx.rego#L90[Source, window="_blank"]

[#sbom_cyclonedx__allowed_package_sources]
=== link:#sbom_cyclonedx__allowed_package_sources[Allowed package sources]

For each of the components fetched by Cachi2 which define externalReferences of type distribution, verify they are allowed based on the allowed_package_sources rule data key. By default, allowed_package_sources is empty, which means no components with such references are allowed.

*Solution*: Update the image to not use a package from a disallowed source.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package %s fetched by cachi2 was sourced from %q which is not allowed`
* Code: `sbom_cyclonedx.allowed_package_sources`

[#sbom_cyclonedx__disallowed_package_attributes]
=== link:#sbom_cyclonedx__disallowed_package_attributes[Disallowed package attributes]

Confirm the CycloneDX SBOM contains only packages without disallowed attributes. By default all attributes are allowed. Use the "disallowed_attributes" rule data key to provide a list of key-value pairs that forbid the use of an attribute set to the given value.

*Solution*: Update the image to not use any disallowed package attributes.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Package %s has the attribute %q set%s`
* Code: `sbom_cyclonedx.disallowed_package_attributes`

[#sbom_cyclonedx__valid]
=== link:#sbom_cyclonedx__valid[Valid]

Check the CycloneDX SBOM has the expected format. It verifies the CycloneDX SBOM matches the 1.5 version of the schema.

*Solution*: Make sure the build process produces a valid CycloneDX SBOM.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `CycloneDX SBOM at index %d is not valid: %s`
* Code: `sbom_cyclonedx.valid`
