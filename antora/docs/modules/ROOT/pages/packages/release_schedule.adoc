== Rules Included

[#schedule__date_restriction]
=== link:#schedule__date_restriction[Date Restriction]

Check if the current date is not allowed based on the rule data value from the key `disallowed_dates`. By default, the list is empty in which case *any* day is allowed. This check is enforced only for a "release" or "production" pipeline, as determined by the value of the `pipeline_intention` rule data.

*Solution*: Try again on a different day.
