[#base_image_registries__allowed_registries_provided]
=== link:#base_image_registries__allowed_registries_provided[Allowed base image registry prefixes list was provided]

Confirm the `allowed_registry_prefixes` rule data was provided, since it's required by the policy rules in this package.

[#base_image_registries__base_image_permitted]
=== link:#base_image_registries__base_image_permitted[Base image comes from permitted registry]

Verify that the base images used when building a container image come from a known set of trusted registries to reduce potential supply chain attacks. By default this policy defines trusted registries as registries that are fully maintained by Red Hat and only contain content produced by Red Hat. The list of permitted registries can be customized by setting the `allowed_registry_prefixes` list in the rule data. Base images that are found in the snapshot being validated are also allowed since EC will also validate those images individually.

*Solution*: Make sure the image used in each task comes from a trusted registry. The list of trusted registries is a configurable xref:ec-cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data source].

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#

[#buildah_build_task__add_capabilities_param]
=== link:#buildah_build_task__add_capabilities_param[ADD_CAPABILITIES parameter]

Verify the ADD_CAPABILITIES parameter of a builder Tasks was not used.

*Solution*: The ADD_CAPABILITIES parameter is not allowed for most container image builds. This, however, might be required for certain build types, e.g. flatpaks. Either unset the parameter or use a policy config that excludes this policy rule.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#

=== link:#buildah_build_task__platform_param[PLATFORM parameter]

Verify the value of the PLATFORM parameter of a builder Task is allowed by matching against a list of disallowed patterns. The list of patterns can be customized via the `disallowed_platform_patterns` rule data key. If empty, all values are allowed.

*Solution*: Use a different PLATFORM value that is not disallowed by the policy config.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `PLATFORM parameter value %q is disallowed by regex %q`

[#cve_package]
== link:#cve_package[CVE checks]

This package is responsible for verifying a CVE scan was performed during the build pipeline, and that the image under test does not contain CVEs of certain security levels.

The behaviour of the rules in this package is influenced by rule data. Firstly the rules can be configured to emit violations or warnings based on the availability of the vulnerability fix: patched -- if there is a remediation available, e.g. new version with a fix, or unpatched -- if there is, currently, no remidiation available. Secondly per severity: critical, high, medium, low or unknown choice can be made of the rule outcome: failure or warning. And lastly, per severity, choice can be made of how many leeway days are allowed before a vulnerability causing a failure will be reported as a warning instead.

In the following example if rule data configuration, failures will be reported for critical and high patched vulnerabilities, for critical unpatched vulnerabilities only, warnings will be reported for medium and low patched, and for high and medium unpatched vulnerabilities. For critical and high patched vulnerabilities a leeway of 10 days is allowed.

.Example rule data

* Package name: `cve`

[#cve__cve_blockers]
=== link:#cve__cve_blockers[Blocking CVE check]

The SLSA Provenance attestation for the image is inspected to ensure CVEs that have a known fix and meet a certain security level have not been detected. If detected, this policy rule will fail. By default, only CVEs of critical and high security level cause a failure. This is configurable by the rule data key `restrict_cve_security_levels`. The available levels are critical, high, medium, low, and unknown. In addition to that leeway can be granted per severity using the `cve_leeway` rule data key containing days of allowed leeway, measured as time between found vulnerability's public disclosure date and current effective time, per severity level.

*Solution*: Make sure to address any CVE's related to the image.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Found %q vulnerability of %s security level`
* Code: `cve.cve_blockers`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/cve/cve.rego#L114[Source, window="_blank"]

[#cve__unpatched_cve_blockers]
=== link:#cve__unpatched_cve_blockers[Blocking unpatched CVE check]

The SLSA Provenance attestation for the image is inspected to ensure CVEs that do NOT have a known fix and meet a certain security level have not been detected. If detected, this policy rule will fail. By default, the list of security levels used by this policy is empty. This is configurable by the rule data key `restrict_unpatched_cve_security_levels`. The available levels are critical, high, medium, low, and unknown. In addition to that leeway can be granted per severity using the `cve_leeway` rule data key containing days of allowed leeway, measured as time between found vulnerability's public disclosure date and current effective time, per severity level.

*Solution*: CVEs without a known fix can only be remediated by either removing the impacted dependency, or by waiting for a fix to be available.

[#tasks_package]
== link:#tasks_package[Tasks]

Conforma expects that a set of tasks were included in the pipeline build for each image to be released. This package includes a set of rules to verify that the expected tasks ran in the pipeline when the image was built. Required tasks for a pipeline are specified in a data source provided at runtime. This data source features two primary rule data keys: pipeline-required-tasks and required-tasks. The pipeline-required-tasks key lists all required tasks broken down by pipeline name, while required-tasks details a default or baseline set of tasks. If your pipeline corresponds to an entry under pipeline-required-tasks, those tasks will be prioritized; otherwise, the system will default to the tasks listed under required-tasks. Required tasks are listed by the names given to them within the task definition. Optionally invocation parameter of a Task can be also mandated by including the name and the value in square brackets following the name of the task. For example: name[PARAM=val]. Only single parameter is supported, to assert multiple parameters repeat the required task definition for each parameter seperately.

Check the trust of the Tekton Tasks used in the build Pipeline. There are two modes in which trust is verified. The first mode is used if Trusted Artifacts are enabled. In this case, a chain of trust is established for all the Tasks involved in creating an artifact. If the chain contains an untrusted Task, then a violation is emitted. The second mode is used as a fallback when Trusted Artifacts are not enabled. In this case, **all** Tasks in the build Pipeline must be trusted.

*Solution*: If using Trusted Artifacts, be sure every Task in the build Pipeline responsible for producing a Trusted Artifact is trusted. Otherwise, ensure **all** Tasks in the build Pipeline are trusted. Note that trust is eventually revoked from Tasks when newer versions are made available.
